# CI jobs:


# When Formatter fails
 Run locally:
`
cargo fmt --all
`
And push again :)

# When CI-build fails:
It means your code doesn't compile! *PANIC*
Repair your code!! Please..

# When CI-CLIPPY fails
You should correct what it prints for you (probably you have something unused, or you could pass it by reference, etc..)
